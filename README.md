# Recommender-Systems-in-Python
Recommender systems, used by tech companies like Amazon, YouTube, and Facebook, predict user ratings and preferences, and can be classified into simple recommenders, content-based recommenders, and collaborative filtering engines.

Recommender systems can be classified into three types: Simple recommenders, Content-based recommenders, and collaborative filtering engines.
• Simple recommenders offer generalized recommendations based on movie popularity and/or genre.
• Content-based recommenders suggest similar items based on a particular item using item metadata.
• Collaborative filtering engines predict user ratings or preferences based on past ratings and preferences of other users.
